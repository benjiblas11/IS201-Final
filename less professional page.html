<h1>  Why deadmau5 Inspires Me  </h1> 
<h2> As was seen on my resume, I am very invested in music production. deadmau5 has been a part of my life since I was a wee lad, 
    and he's been a big catalyst for that interest. 
    I've developed a small list of reasons his music is so inspiring and interesting to me
     and how he's helped me develop my current musical style, interest, and taste. </h2>

    <li id="blah1"> Incredible Live Performances </li><br>
    <p> Over the years, deadmau5 has developed his own visuals to match the energy and sound of his music.
        Alongside the basic visuals and color pallette, he has also created different variations of a 
        stage he developed alongside a team of engineers. I've come to really enjoy audio visual presentations 
        and love to see the creativity displayed in enhancing sonic experiences. It encourages me to create a complete 
        and all-encompassing project when I work on my own music.

    <p> Alongside an impressive visual performance, deadmau5' music is characterized by having unique and interesting 
        progression and sounds developed especially for his tracks. Some of these sounds are created with physical hardware
         and can be difficult to recreate using software (which is the most common method of developing new sounds).

         Though I don't have all of the equipment he does, deadmau5' music is a prime example of how sounds and textures breathe fresh 
         air into music. With electronics, the sonic possibilities are limitless as we develop new tones and textures that have never
         been created or heard. This inspires me to find and create new sounds as I compose my own music.

    <p>  One of the most engaging results of his unique sound is his ability to consistently sound distict despite 
        creating such a large variety of different genres. Though his songs are composed with different tempos, sounds, 
        and sometimes time signatures, each song sounds exactly like he made it. These defining characteristics of his always 
        inspire me to think outside of the box and create something that only I would or could. I don't confine myself to one type of music,
        but rather I express myself in different ways with whatever style comes out. <br><br>
        Here is a incomplete but dynamic list showing the ranges reached over the course of his discography:
